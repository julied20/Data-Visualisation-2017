								<h2 class="animate-box">Motivations</h2>
								<p class="animate-box">
									The idea behind the stories is to guide the user in our visualisation
									and help him understand how theses products export devolpment through the
									years, and in different regions.
									For the stories, we selected three iconic products, French Wine, Peruvian Quinoa
									and Indenosian Palm Oil, either for their  popularity or controversy.
								</p>

								<h2 class="animate-box">Story Selection</h2>
								<p class="animate-box">
									We selected stories based some interesting
									aspects that could be shown such as a shift in the
									trade flow towards a certain region, controversial
									prodcuts that have a major impact on today's society.
								</p>

								<h3 class="animate-box">French Wines</h3>
								<p class="animate-box">
									France is known for their fine food, but also for their wine.
									The export of french wine always existed, but since the begining
									of the 21th century french wine became more and more popular in Asia.
									In China, Japan and Singapore, are now part of the top french wine importer
								</p>
								<img class="animate-box map_images" id = 'wine' src="../static/img/original/wine.jpeg" alt="Wine">

								<h3 class="animate-box">Peruvian Quinoa</h3>
								<p class="animate-box">
									Quinoa is the most popular health food. This grain was
									consumed by the locals for centuries, but now we can find it
									in every stores and restaurants. The UN even branded, 2013
									the year of Quinoa. The demand rised and the price peaks
									in 2014, when the price of a kilogram of Quinoa was 7 dollar.
									The average consumption of Quinoa in Peru fell, and the Guardian
									accused the "heedless Western hipster" of princing poor Andeans
									out of their staple food. The price rose was quick and only
									during one year, this suggest that this switch has nothing to do
									with this.
								</p>
								<img class="animate-box map_images" id='quinoa' src="../static/img/original/quinoa.jpeg" alt="Quinoa">

								<h3 class="animate-box">Indonesian Palm Oil</h3>
								<p class="animate-box">
									Palm oil is used in retail food and snack manufacturers
									as well as in cosmetices and biofuel and energy. The
									advantages of using this oil seems numerous. For
									example, the palm plant is about 10 times as
									productive as a plant like a soya bean or a rapeseed.
									Palm oil also have benefits against animal fat because
									it is cheaper to produce.
									This product became very popular through the years, we can
									find palm oil everywhere in a lot of product, one of the
									most popular being the Nutella. But palm oil doesn't have
									only advantages. When the demand on Palm oil start rising,
									with it the deforestation of the Amazonian forest.
									The expansion of palm oil plantation is alo the main
									threat to the orangutan survival.
								</p>

								<h2 class="animate-box">Integrations of the Stories</h2>
								<p class="animate-box">
									We integrated the Stories in the navigation bar.
									The navigation bar is divided in two parts; the stories part and the
									exploration part.
								</p>
								<p class="animate-box">
									On the Story side, we can choose between our three stories
									When we select a story, a short introduction about the product
									appear before the beginning of the story.
									The user also have the possibility to select a product in exploration mode.
									In the Exploration mode, we can explorate the data of our three stories, and
									also the data of other products we studied, like Belgium Beer of
									Swiss Chocolate.
								</p>

								<h2 class="animate-box">Story Elements</h2>
								<p class="animate-box">
									We have several element that animate our story.
								</p>
								<h6 class="animate-box">Roll Year</h6>
								<p class="animate-box">
									Roll year is an animation which go through the years
									of the trades. It animate the timeline, the map and
									the graph.
								</p>
								<h6 class="animate-box">Popover</h6>
								<p class="animate-box">
									The popovers are windows poping at strategic points of
									the story to give the user more information about a specifique
									year, trande or country
								</p>
								<h6 class="animate-box">Next Button</h6>
								<p class="animate-box">
									The user can navigate through the stories using the next
									button which activate the next chapter of the story. At
									the end of the story, a next story button appear to go to
									the following one. At the end of the last story, a button appear to guide
									the user into the exploration part of the visualisation.
								</p>

								<h2 class="animate-box">Screencast</h2>
								<p class="animate-box">
									Finally, we created the screencast which can also be found <a href="https://youtu.be/RXe8R1G2hUY">here</a>.
